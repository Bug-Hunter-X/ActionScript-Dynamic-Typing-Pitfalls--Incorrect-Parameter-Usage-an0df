This example demonstrates a common issue in ActionScript 3 related to function parameters.  Because ActionScript uses dynamic typing, it doesn't explicitly check parameter types at compile-time. This can cause hard-to-debug errors at runtime. The included example shows a function accepting both String and int, and how different incorrect uses might lead to a runtime error, silently ignoring extra parameter(s), or using wrong value.
